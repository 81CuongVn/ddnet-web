The DDNet [Ranks](/ranks/) pages have been paginated, see for example [Brutal](/ranks/brutal/). This should improve performance on mobile devices. Note that these ranks pages are only updated once per hour.

Every map now also has its own [map page](/maps/) with instantly updated ranks, see for example [octotorp by Rovikko](/maps/octotorp). This also allows easily searching for a map.

As a consequence the browser-based map preview moved from /maps/ to [/mappreview/](/mappreview/), see for example [Diamond Mine](/mappreview/?map=Diamond+Mine).
