The new `/swap` feature allows two players in a team to swap their position. It had a bug that kept a player hooked when they were swapped. This allowed skipping parts on many maps:

Thanks to murpi for the video demonstration.

We were only notified of this problem after it had been abused already. Using teehistorian and with the help of Learath2 we determined a list of suspicious ranks and then checked them manually. The following were cheated:

```
Fiasko
1. Blurry, Cireme, Fluday & =Pipou=

Destiny 1
1. Blurry, Cireme, Fluday & =Pipou=
5. simple & HaHAxD*

Destiny 2
1. Blurry, Cireme, Fluday & =Pipou=
```
