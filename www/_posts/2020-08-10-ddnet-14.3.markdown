DDNet 14.3 has just been released with a new server-side feature, making it much easier to run your own server with a SQLite-based ranks database. This removes support for the old file-based ranks. This feature and lots of surrounding cleanups has been implemented by [Zwelf](/players/Zwelf/)!

As always, read more of the changelog and download DDNet on the [Downloads page](/downloads/).
