We will stop hosting official DDNet servers in Brazil. We are not sure when exactly the hoster will shut us down. Huge thanks to [RafaelFF](/players/RafaelFF/) for sponsoring the server for the past years! (And also for maintaining the [DDNet ArchLinux AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ddnet/) and [DDNet ArchWiki entry](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/DDRaceNetwork).)

The situation is that there are only a few players on Brazil server, but the costs are quite high at about 20 â‚¬ / month. We had to reconsider as RafaelFF could no longer pay by his usual method, and we would have had to set up a new server anyway since the hoster stopped offering virtual servers (or renamed them to cloud, depending on your PoV).

Hopefully the Chile servers are close enough that Brazilian players can play there.
