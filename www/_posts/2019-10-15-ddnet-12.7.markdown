DDNet 12.7 has been released today with the following highlights:

<ul>
  <li><strong>[Server] Allow to hammer directly on unfreeze. Previously, this was only doable with frame-perfect input if you were going to get frozen again the next tick. Now, you only have to hold your hammer to immediately hammer once you get unfrozen.</strong></li>
  <li>[Client] Numbers centered for OpenGL 3.3 [<strong>Andrii</strong>]</li>
  <li>[Client] Add tunezone prediction [<strong>trml</strong>]</li>
  <li>[Client] Add toggle keyboard shortcuts button to demo player [<strong>jao</strong>]</li>
  <li>[Client] Don't highlight window when playing demo</li>
  <li>[Client] Fix keeping tmp replay demo file on map change [<strong>archimede67</strong>]</li>
  <li>[Client] Fix skin reset [<strong>jao</strong>]</li>
  <li>[Editor] Add a saner way to select angles [<strong>Learath2</strong>]</li>
  <li>[Server] Fix telegun save [<strong>Ryozuki</strong>]</li>
  <li>[Server] Handle 0 star random map votes [<strong>jao</strong>]</li>
  <li>[Server] Fix filescore path [<strong>ChillerDragon</strong>]</li>
  <li>[Server] Mark players as afk initially [<strong>Learath2</strong>]</li>
  <li>[Server] Fix show_ips to show regular formatting</li>
</ul>
