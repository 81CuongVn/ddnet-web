With a huge thanks to Learath2 we now have a Teeworlds 0.7 compatibility layer in the official DDNet servers. This means you can play together on the same servers, whether you're using DDNet client, Teeworlds 0.6, [F-Client](https://fokkonaut.github.io/F-Client/), [ZillyWoods Client](https://zillywoods.github.io/ZillyWoods-web/) or Teeworlds 0.7. Please test the feature and report bugs on [Discord](https://ddnet.tw/discord) or [GitHub](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/).

The feature will also soon be released in the next DDNet version. Stay tuned!
