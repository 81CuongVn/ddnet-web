Previously the recent top records on DDNet were only visible in the #records channel on our [Discord server](/discord). Now they are also displayed prominently on the [Status page](/status/), where you can toggle whether to see the top records of the last day or the last week. You can also use a feed reader to keep up with the most recent top records using the [Atom feed](https://ddnet.tw/status/records/feed/) we provide.

While we're at it, you can also check out:

- [Recent map releases](https://ddnet.tw/releases/) ([feed](https://ddnet.tw/releases/feed/))
- [News](https://ddnet.tw/news/) ([feed](https://ddnet.tw/feed/))
- [Downloads](https://ddnet.tw/downloads/) (use the autoupdater or OS updater)
